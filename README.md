# Seedlings
Code for the Kaggle Plant Seendlings Classification Competition

Notebooks train Xception and DeepNet201 convolutional architectures.

DeepNet and Xception are trained on the top layer first, and then all layers

Train/Validation split is 80/20.

Validation is measured using acuracy.

DeepNet Results: 97.2% accuray.

Xception Resuts: 97.4% accuray.
